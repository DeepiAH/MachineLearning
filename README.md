## General Information

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
Company needs to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
Business goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Dataset used : day.csv


## Conclusion

Analyzed the datasets and understood various columns and relation with each other with the help of data dictionary understood the values of categorical variables. Using linear regreesion model could drop the columns and top 3 variables which increase the demand of bike sharing are windspeed ,year and season.
R2 value from test data is 75.6% and R2 value from train data is 73.75%.
